DM2008 FINAL PROJECT

# Final Project Concept
- Commentary on society’s demand for constant achievement and self-improvement.
- Pressured to adapt, perform, and “keep up,” regardless of whether it was worth it.
- Designed to feel pointless, irritating, and overstimulating, yet still oddly fun and addictive.
- Represents how people push themselves through obstacles without questioning the purpose, highlighting the absurdity of working hard toward goals that may be arbitrary or unrewarding, and ultimately encouraging players to reflect on whether the struggle is worth it.

# Construction of the game
- There are three game states: “Start”, “Landing”, “Playing” and “Ending”.
- Starting word is “pineapple”.
- Contains Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3 logic.
- Round 1: 5 seconds countdown for each question
- Round 2: 4 seconds countdown + Dog appears & begins spinning (slow) + Word begins pulsing (slow scale animation) + Music speeds up slightly and gets louder
- Round 3: 3 seconds countdown + Round lasts for 2 minutes + Dog spins faster + Word pulses faster + Music speeds up more and gets louder.
- Ending screen shows “Congrats”, and Final Score.
- Lasts 15 seconds before restarting to the first screen.
