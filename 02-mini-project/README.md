DM2008 MINI PROJECT

# Mini Project
- Press spacebar to initiate bird flap
- If bird position is overlapping with pipe, it detects collision and game restarts
- Added gameState variables and score system, so that it detects what to display (Start Screen/Game Over Screen) based on game play
- Preload image for background 
- Preload sound for background music, sound effects when jumping and game over screen
- Adjusted pipe gap and flap strength
- Adjusted pipe and bird colours to stand out from the background
